about: Wanting to host the meetup? Answer the following questions

Thank you for wanting to host the Ruby Usergroup Hamburg!
Here we have collected some information regarding hosting the Usergroup.
Additionally, it would be great if you could answer the questions at the end of the issue. This will help us to have a good overview

# FAQ

## When can I host the meetup
We meet every **second Wednesday** of the month
Any [event](https://hamburg.onruby.de/#events) where no location is named still requires one

## How much space do we need?
There have been **17** Rubyists signed up on average for the latest events and there were about **1** to **2** presentations held. 

Those numbers are just guidelines, make sure to talk to one of the [organizers](https://hamburg.onruby.de/#topics) when preparing the hosting.

If you don't have a lot of space, it's also possible to *limit* the number of participants.

## What's needed for a Usergroup?
The location, of course, but there is more to it:
 * alcohol-free beverages
 * beamer and adapters
 * beer (optional)
 * snacks/pizza (optional)

You don't need to make a fuss, we are cool with the bare minimum!
We believe everyone should be able to host the meetup. A limited budget, because you are an NGO or a small company, should not be a stopper.
